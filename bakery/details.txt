Yes — adding account management will make it look much more professional without making it overwhelming.

Here’s how the Online Cake & Bakery Ordering App with Accounts could work:

Features (with Accounts):

User Registration & Login (Django auth or django-allauth for social login)

Profile page with order history, saved addresses, and payment preferences

Product catalog with categories (cakes, pastries, cookies, bread, etc.)

Custom cake builder (choose size, flavor, icing, decorations)

Shopping cart & checkout flow

Payment integration using Stripe or PayPal Sandbox

Order tracking via profile or by order ID/email for guests

Admin panel to manage products, users, and orders

Mobile-first responsive design

Extra touches for portfolio impact:

Add a "Reorder" button in order history for quick repeat orders

Include wishlist/favorites feature

Email confirmation for account registration and successful order

Show different homepage banners for logged-in vs guest users

Allow guest checkout but prompt for signup after payment
