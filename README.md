# ozdogan-portfolio

This is my personal portfolio, created to showcase my work and skills as a full stack web developer.

## Project 1: Simple Restaurant

The Simple Restaurant Project is a full-stack web application built with Django 5 and Django REST Framework, showcasing my ability to design, develop, and deploy modern, mobile-responsive websites. The platform allows visitors to browse a visually appealing menu with detailed item pages, make and check reservations in real-time via a REST API, and navigate through engaging sections like Home, About, and Contact. I implemented custom error pages (400, 404, 500) for a professional user experience, structured the back-end with efficient database models, and styled the front-end using clean HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for seamless responsiveness across devices. This project demonstrates my skills in backend development, API design, responsive UI/UX, database management, and production-ready deployment.
